# Phase 5 Status: Script Execution & Monitoring

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Phase**: 5 of 8 - Script Execution & Monitoring  

## üéØ Phase Objectives

**Script Execution & Monitoring** successfully implemented:

1. **‚úÖ Script Execution Engine** - Safe execution of PowerShell, AppleScript, and Bash scripts
2. **‚úÖ Execution Monitoring** - Real-time monitoring of script execution with logging
3. **‚úÖ Safety & Sandboxing** - Execution policies and security measures
4. **‚úÖ Performance Metrics** - Execution time, resource usage, and success rates
5. **‚úÖ Error Handling & Recovery** - Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## üöÄ New Components Implemented

### 1. Script Executor (`src/core/script_executor.py`)
- **ExecutionRequest/ExecutionResult** dataclasses for structured execution
- **ExecutionPolicy** enum with SAFE, RESTRICTED, STANDARD, ELEVATED levels
- **ExecutionStatus** enum for tracking execution states
- **ExecutionMetrics** for performance monitoring
- Platform-specific execution handling (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Safety validation with blocked command detection
- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, I/O, network)
- Timeout handling and process termination

### 2. Execution Monitor (`src/core/execution_monitor.py`)
- **ExecutionTask/TaskMetrics** dataclasses for task management
- **TaskStatus/TaskPriority** enums for task organization
- Priority-based task queue with concurrent execution limits
- Real-time task monitoring and status updates
- Callback system for status changes and completion
- Execution history with filtering and cleanup
- System statistics and performance metrics

### 3. Enhanced BK25Core Integration
- Script execution methods with policy enforcement
- Task submission and management
- Execution history and statistics
- System resource monitoring
- Execution monitoring lifecycle management

## üîß New API Endpoints

### Script Execution
- `POST /api/execute/script` - Execute script directly
- `POST /api/execute/task` - Submit execution task
- `GET /api/execute/task/{task_id}` - Get task status
- `DELETE /api/execute/task/{task_id}` - Cancel task
- `GET /api/execute/history` - Get execution history
- `GET /api/execute/statistics` - Get system statistics
- `GET /api/execute/running` - Get running tasks

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Execution Policies
- **SAFE**: Only read-only, non-destructive commands
- **RESTRICTED**: Limited system access, controlled operations
- **STANDARD**: Normal execution with safety checks
- **ELEVATED**: Elevated privileges (admin/sudo)

### Safety Measures
- Blocked command detection (rm, delete, format, etc.)
- Safe command whitelisting
- Timeout enforcement (max 1 hour)
- Working directory isolation
- Environment variable sanitization

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Execution Metrics
- Execution time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU utilization
- I/O operation counting
- Network connection tracking

### System Statistics
- Total tasks executed
- Success/failure rates
- Average execution times
- Recent 24-hour performance
- Queue status and capacity

## üîÑ Task Management

### Task Lifecycle
1. **QUEUED** - Task submitted to priority queue
2. **PREPARING** - Task being prepared for execution
3. **RUNNING** - Task actively executing
4. **COMPLETED/FAILED** - Task finished
5. **CANCELLED** - Task cancelled by user
6. **PAUSED** - Task temporarily suspended

### Priority Levels
- **LOW** - Background tasks
- **NORMAL** - Standard operations
- **HIGH** - Important tasks

## üéØ Next Phase

**Phase 6: Web Interface & API** - Complete web interface and API endpoints
- Implement missing API endpoints (`/api/personas/current`, `/api/channels/current`, `/api/personas/create`)
- Test web interface functionality
- Validate persona and channel selection
- Verify code generation display

## üìã Migration Progress

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Persona System & Memory  
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Channel Simulation
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Code Generation System
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Script Execution & Monitoring
- üîÑ **Phase 6**: Web Interface & API (In Progress)
- ‚è≥ **Phase 7**: Testing & Quality Assurance
- ‚è≥ **Phase 8**: Docker & Deployment
